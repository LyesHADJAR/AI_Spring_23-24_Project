# AI_Spring_23-24_Project : Agricultural land production planning

## Overview 
This is an implementation of many search algorithms that were delt with during the course of Introducton to AI - Spring 2023/24

## Project Aim :
Organise the agricultural production in Algeria so as to optimize various objectives.

## Instructions :
a. Find out what each city/Wilaya is good at, what is its yearly production, size of the land used
for agriculture and what it grows, productivity, etc.
b. What is the countryâ€™s consumption of main products: wheat, corn, dates, potatoes, tomatoes,
green pepper, aubergines,
c. Changes in product prices according to the seasons
d. Suppose we ultimately want to:
i. Have the lowest prices for the consumer (what does lowest price mean? Think about a
meaningful definition)
ii. Have the highest production (in some products? Some strategic products? Etc.?)
iii. Self-sufficiency in the production of products (all? some products? Some strategic
products? Etc.?)
e. Define an appropriate objective function whenever needed.
f. Apply different search strategies: 2 uninformed, A* or IDA* and Hill Climbing (any of its
versions),
i. Do comparative analyses and suggest the best assignment of agricultural production in the
country. The comparative analyses should be about the search for the solution and also about
the cost in terms of time and space requirements.
g. Tackle the same problem as a constraint-satisfaction problem using any of the techniques to be
seen in class.
h. Compare the results obtained in the previous two questions.
